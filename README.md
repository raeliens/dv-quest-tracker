up-to-date version:
https://raeliens.github.io/dv-quest-tracker/


a visual tracker for completing daily quests from npcs on dappervolk. there are seven buttons for seven daily quests for each npc. click each button to cycle through colors to mark quest progress: red for incomplete, yellow for in progress, green for complete.

click the heart next to the npc to toggle whether or not you've chit-chatted with them.

collapse the box for a town by clicking its name in the header. click the moon on the top right corner to toggle dark/higher contrast mode.

happy questing!
